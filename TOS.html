                    <p class="terms-text"> In compliance with our rental agreement,
                      reservations of SLS equipment must be made at least two full
                      days in advance of rental date, and five full days previous to
                      rentals that require additional arrangements (technicians or transportation),
                      so that SLS may generate a contract and equipment list to be
                      available to the renter within two days of the booking date.
                      Failure to comply with this will result in the loss of any
                      potential discounts, and may incur a fine.</p>
                    <p class="terms-text"> Reservations may be made on via our
                      online form, over the phone, or in person at our office
                      in the Memorial Union Building Room 106. </p>

                    <h4 class="terms-heading">Cancellations</h4>
                    <p class="terms-text">Notice of cancellation of services
                      must be submitted at least 24 hours in advance of intended
                      use. Failure to do so may result in a charge of thirty dollars
                      ($30), or the full cost of the rental, whichever is less. </p>
                    </br>
                    <h4 class="terms-heading">Rental Fees</h4>
                    <p class="terms-text">Rental fees are determined by a rate
                      structure that varies with the value of the item and the
                      term of the rental. Rental prices given are for the first
                      three days of rental. Contact us for rates over three days. </p>
                    <p class="terms-text">If transportation is required, delivery
                      must be arranged at least five days prior to the rental
                      term, and has a base charge of forty-five dollars ($45) with
                      each mile away from campus incurring an additional one dollar
                      fee for each mile. Delivery is only applicable to the
                      Houghton and Hancock areas. </p>
                    <p class="terms-text">If you need an SLS Technician to assist
                      you in running the equipment, SLS classifies the rental as
                      an event and it must be arranged through SLS’ Operations
                      Coordinator at least one week in advance. Note: Certain
                      items require that an SLS Technician be present. </p>
                    </br>
                    <h4 class="terms-heading">Equipment Pick Up and Return </h4>
                    <p class="terms-text">A valid state photo ID (driver’s license)
                      is required for equipment pickup. Additionally, if the renter
                      has any concerns or questions about the rental equipment,
                      all equipment is available for inspection the day of the
                      rental. If the renter requires any technical help with the
                      equipment, SLS will provide basic equipment setup, which
                      can be explained when the equipment is picked up. Any
                      additional technical help or service provided by SLS
                      employees may be justification for additional charges.</p>
                    <p class="terms-text">At the drop off time, if the equipment
                        is not cleaned, or cables are not neatly coiled, the
                        renter will be charged labor costs determined by SLS for
                        the cleaning and/ or organization of the equipment with a
                        $5 minimum. Late equipment drop off rates are 35% per day
                        with a $10 per day minimum fine. If items are returned
                        late, any applicable discounts are also forfeited. </p>
                    </br>
                    <h4 class="terms-heading">Renter's Responsibility </h4>
                    <p class="terms-text">Let it be known to the renter that SLS
                      equipment is not insured by SLS for the duration of the rental.
                      Any damages or missing items are the sole responsibility of
                      the renter. All rentals are for personal use only; equipment
                      may not be sub-rented or used for profit by the renter. Any
                      rental used for personal profit voids any and all discount
                      that the renter may have qualified for.</p>
                    <p class="terms-text">Any problem with the equipment must be
                      reported as soon as the renter discovers it. If needed,
                      replacement equipment will be supplied to the best of our
                      abilities and availability. Any price adjustments due to
                      failure will be determined by SLS; price adjustments will
                      always be in the favor of the renter.</p>
                    <p class="terms-text">Any attempted, unauthorized service or
                      alteration will result in additional charges determined by
                      SLS. If an item is lost during the duration of the rental
                      agreement, the renter will be liable for the full replacement
                      cost of the item. If an item is damaged during the duration
                      of the rental agreement, the renter will be liable for the
                      repair or replacement cost of the item. To insure the protection
                      of SLS equipment and or employees, SLS must be allowed access
                      to inspect the equipment at any point in time and has the
                      option to remove the equipment for failure to meet with the
                      terms of the contract or for the protection of personal
                      and equipment.</p>
                    </br>
                    </br>
                    <p class="text-muted">If it is found that the renter has breached
                      or violated this contract, SLS reserves the right to impose a
                      fine of up to $1000.00 as it sees fit. The renter, and possibly
                      the organization with which there are representing, may also
                      be prohibited from future business dealings with SLS.</p>

                    production company providing event services to the student
                    organizations of Michigan Technological University and University
                    sponsored events; this excludes events held in the Rozsa Center
                    for the Performing Arts. </p>
                  <p class="terms-text">The management team of SLS is comprised
                    of the following: General Manager/ President, Operations

                    Coordinator/ Treasurer, Senior Storeroom Manager, and

                    one Assistant Storeroom Manager. </p>
                  <p class="terms-text">The Client is the person or organization
                      who requested SLS’ services, or the organization that brought
                      the event to campus. </p>
                  <p class="terms-text">A rental is when SLS’ equipment is
                    borrowed without need for assistance in running the equipment;
                    minor setup (not to exceed 2.5 total man hours) of equipment
                    is allowed with rentals. </p>
                  <p class="terms-text">A service or rental request [Request] is
                    filling out the request form found on SLS’ website. In the
                    event of form problems or closure for updating, email with
                    the proper information for the event will be considered an
                    official request. </p>
                  <p class="terms-text">Equipment is anything in the possession
                    of SLS, including the services provided by our employees.
                    This includes, but is not limited to, setting up equipment,
                    DJ services, FOH engineering, and tearing down equipment. </p>
                  </br>
                  <h4 class="terms-heading">Clause 1: Equipment Availability and Timelines</h4>
                  <p class="terms-text">Throughout the year there are times when equipment
                     is in high demand and careful planning is necessary to make
                     every event a success. Thus, all requests for event service
                     or rentals must be made at least 48 hours in advance to the
                     start time of the event or rental. Failure to do so will
                     result in no guarantees for equipment or personnel availability,
                     and SLS cannot be held responsible for loss due to equipment
                     availability. Further, all requests must be processed through
                     our online form system found at sls.mtu.edu under the
                     services tab. In addition, equipment availability and
                     all SLS’ services are limited during Michigan Technological
                     University’s summer term. Inquiries for rentals or services
                     are welcome during this time, but they may not be fulfilled
                     due to the unavailability of SLS’ employees. If this is the
                     case, the client will be notified by their preferred
                     communication method in a timely manner at least 3 business
                     days before the event or at the time of the request. </p>
                  </br>
                  <h4 class="terms-heading">Clause 1.1: Urgent Requests </h4>
                  <p class="terms-text">If your request for service is urgent,
                    you should contact SLS via email or phone to inform us of
                    your request. Note: you will be directed to our online form,
                    but your advance notice will allow us to reserve the equipment
                    you need and give your event priority over ones that fill
                    out a form after you have contacted us.</p>
                  </br>
                  <h4 class="terms-heading">Clause 1.2: Repeating Events</h4>
                  <p class="terms-text">If an event regularly repeats, we encourage
                    filling out the repeating event section of the request form.
                    If this option is utilized, the form is only required once for
                    the duration of the repeating event, e.g. 5 years. With each
                    repeat of the event, the organizers are required to contact SLS
                    via email with the date, time, and any additional information that
                    may have changed from the previous event; a new form is not
                    required to be completed. </p>
                  </br>
                  <h4 class="terms-heading">Clause 1.3: Event Precedence</h4>
                  <p class="terms-text">The precedence of a request will be based
                    heavily, if not entirely, on the time when the request was made.
                    Requests made first will be allocated their desired equipment or
                    setup first. If there are conflicting events on the same day, the
                    organization that made the request first will receive their full
                    specification. The second, third, etc organizations will receive
                    equipment or setups that are the closest equivalent to their
                    requested specification. Further, this equivalency is not
                    valid justification for requesting a greater discount for
                    services rendered. </p>
                  </br>
                  <h4 class="terms-heading">Clause 1.3.1: Off Campus vs On Campus Precedence</h4>
                  <p class="terms-text">In general, Michigan Tech sponsored events
                    will take priority over outside organizations and events
                    happening on the same day as a University event. SLS is a
                    student organization staffed entirely by students and receives
                    majority of its financial support through the student activity
                    fee. Further, our primary focus is to the Michigan Tech community.
                    However, off campus organizations may rent equipment from SLS for
                    their events, and minor setup or operation may be available upon
                    request. These requests, if made more than 48 hours in advance,
                    will be guaranteed equipment to meet the event’s needs. However,
                    the equipment list given to the client is subject to change to
                    equal or better pieces of equipment if an on campus event needs
                    the particular equipment which was originally on the rental
                    equipment list. Further, if equipment is upgraded due to an
                    on campus event, an increase in price will not occur. </p>

                  <h4 class="terms-heading">Clause 2: Fines</h4>
                  <p class="terms-text">Those found to have broken a rental
                    contract with SLS may be fined up to $1000.00 plus damages
                    or equipment repair cost depending on the severity of the
                    infraction. Late rentals are subject to a 35% per day charge
                    with a $10.00 minimum per day. Any performer or group of
                    performers who intentionally or accidentally damages SLS’
                    equipment will result in the organization who brought the
                    event to campus being responsible for any and all damages that
                    may occur. These damages may include the cost of repair or the
                    full replacement cost for the equipment which was damaged by
                    the performer or group. </p>

                  <p class="terms-text">SLS reserves the right to change these
                    terms as deemed appropriate by the management team. These
                    changes may occur without warning, but clients will be notified
                    when these changes directly affect their business with SLS.</p>
